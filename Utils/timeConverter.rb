# This Ruby CLI app for Time conversion

require 'date'

def show_help
  puts <<~TEXT
    Description: Takes a string with a time representation and outputs a string with a time representation,
                in the process converting the one representation to another.

    Default output representation is 'MM/DD/YYYY'

    Example usage:
        ruby timeConverter.rb '2023-04-17' -i '%Y-%m-%d' -o '%m/%d/%Y'    ===>  Output will be: 04/17/2023
        ruby timeConverter.rb 'January 17, 2023' -i '%B %d, %Y' -o '%d-%m-%Y'  ===>  Output will be: 17-01-2023

        ----  Please use single quotes :)) ------

    How I format data:
        Formats date according to the directives in the given format string.
            The directives begins with a percent (%Q( character.
            Any text not listed as a directive will be passed through to the
            output string.

            The directive consists of a percent (%) character,
            zero or more flags, optional minimum field width,
            optional modifier and a conversion specifier
            as follows.

            %<flags><width><modifier><conversion>

            Flags:
            -  don't pad a numerical output.
            _  use spaces for padding.
            0  use zeros for padding.
            ^  upcase the result string.
            #  change case.
            :  use colons for %z.

            The minimum field width specifies the minimum width.

            The modifier is "E" and "O".
            They are ignored.

            Format directives:

            ISO 8601 week-based year and week number:
            The week 1 of YYYY starts with a Monday and includes YYYY-01-04.
            The days in the year before the first week are in the last week of
            the previous year.
                %G - The week-based year
                %g - The last 2 digits of the week-based year (00..99)
                %V - Week number of the week-based year (01..53)

            Week number:
            The week 1 of YYYY starts with a Sunday or Monday (according to %U
            or %W).  The days in the year before the first week are in week 0.
                %U - Week number of the year.  The week starts with Sunday.  (00..53)
                %W - Week number of the year.  The week starts with Monday.  (00..53)

            Seconds since the Unix Epoch:
                %s - Number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.
                %Q - Number of microseconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.

            Literal string:
                %n - Newline character (\n)
                %t - Tab character (\t)
                %% - Literal ``%'' character

            Combination:
                %c - date and time (%a %b %e %T %Y)
                %D - Date (%m/%d/%y)
                %F - The ISO 8601 date format (%Y-%m-%d)
                %v - VMS date (%e-%b-%Y)
                %x - Same as %D
                %X - Same as %T
                %r - 12-hour time (%I:%M:%S %p)
                %R - 24-hour time (%H:%M)
                %T - 24-hour time (%H:%M:%S)
                %+ - date(1) (%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y)

            This method is similar to strftime() function defined in ISO C and POSIX.
            Several directives (%a, %A, %b, %B, %c, %p, %r, %x, %X, %E*, %O* and %Z)
            are locale dependent in the function.
            However this method is locale independent.
            So, the result may differ even if a same format string is used in other
            systems such as C.
            It is good practice to avoid %x and %X because there are corresponding
            locale independent representations, %D and %T.

            Examples:

            d = DateTime.new(2007,11,19,8,37,48,"-06:00")
                                        #=> #<DateTime: 2007-11-19T08:37:48-0600 ...>
            d.strftime("Printed on %m/%d/%Y")   #=> "Printed on 11/19/2007"
            d.strftime("at %I:%M%p")            #=> "at 08:37AM"
